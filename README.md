AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY

Project Description:
This website reflects my view on the use of Auto-tune typography in design. While I recognize the lack of individuality and the repetition of similar styles in modern graphic design, I don't believe we should completely reject this trend. Instead, I designed this website with an understanding of where these design formulas come from, what they represent, and why they are used. My goal is to make intentional and thoughtful design decisions, rather than just following trends, throughout the design of this site.
