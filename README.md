AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY

Project Description:
In this project, reflect my perspective on this AUTOTUNE TYPOGRAPHY 

I explore the idea of autotune typography by using it as a central design element on the website. While I emphasize the autotune style in the design, I also ensure the text is still easy to read by using a simple, clear font like Roboto. This balance helps to make the design thought-provoking while remaining user-friendly.
